    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These burritos are so good that you'll want to have them every night!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced jalapeno peppers</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>3 ounces cream cheese, cubed</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C). Wrap tortillas in foil.</li>
      <li>Bake wrapped tortillas in the preheated oven until heated through,
        about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion,
        bell pepper, garlic, and jalape√±o; cook and stir for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in beans and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir in
        cream cheese and salt; cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Stir
        in cilantro.</li>
      <li>Spoon filling in a line across the middle of each tortilla. Fold
        opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the
        opposing edges around the filling creating a burrito. Serve
        immediately.</li>
    </ol>
